"as someone living in germany: real madrid winning was fucking hilarious and satisfying. ZDF (the german broadcaster) pretty much reported only about liverpool non-stop before kick-off and basically treated them like a German team simply because Klopp manages them. Their bias was fcking ridiculous. even after the match the journalist suggested to kroos that madrid wasn't the better team instead of congratulatin him and talking about the MASSIVE game madrid had. this country is a so-called ""nichts-gönner-land"" (country full of people who always criticize and shit on others and are merely arrogant and bitter people for the most part \[of course there are exceptions, but the mentality here in germany is honestly sickining sometimes\]).  
  
massive respect to madrid. unfortunately they made themselves very likeable to me this season (see flair). insane mentality. i love that they didnt give a fuck about what anyone said. were underestimated four times straight. people wrote them off. people said chelsea would win. people said city would EASILY win this time. people said liverpool is a sure loss for them. i love their ""anti-hero"" arch. in the end they come out on top with a mic drop. stepped out there, followed their game plan, scored with the few chances they had (IMO Benzema's goal should've counted too as the ""pass"" wasn't intended) and defended extremely well against a tough opponent. Deserved win.  
  
also love seeing a spanish side pick up the trophy after everyone's been talking about the ""english"" rise. Leo and cr7 gone and spain still pretty much dominates in europe. how about that?

"Valverde horrible shot or amazing pass? 

I like to think he knew exactly what he was doing. When he first received the ball, he looked up to see Vinicius making the run. Right before he struck the ball, he did a pass fake (watch closely). Either because in that split second he was about to pass it to Benzema then realized he was offside, or was about to cross but was waiting for Vini to get in perfect position. I think he used Benz as bait, luring TAA/Konate in, waiting for Carvajal to make the outside run (which made VD second guess himself as Robertson was out of position), was about to cross (lobbed, I believe, which everyone was expecting), chose not to, then decided to blast it low and across (which nobody was expecting, except for Vinicius) knowing all along who would be there. 

Now, for the sake of argument, let’s say it was a bad shot. If this is the case, then that is a very smartly aimed shot. Meaning, if he was going to miss anywhere, that was the best possible place to miss. I firmly believe he knew a near post shot would have likely been blocked, saved, in the side netting, or in the stands. He knew it had to be far post, but was in a difficult position/situation to score. He decided his best chance was to blast it low, hard, and across the face of goal. That way, even if Alisson gets his gloves on it, there was a chance he would spill the ball from the pace. If he spilled the ball, it would land in the vicinity of Vinicius. So, even if it was a poor shot, it was a smart decision. 

Either way, in my mind, it was a moment of pure brilliance from Federico.

He made some incredible passes but his defensive work was.... horrendous... with exception to some of his amazing passes, he always loses the ball with simple passes.

Konate in particular was a beast. He anticipated so many through balls to Vini and Benzema. He made great runs from the back and brought the ball forward numerous times. Van Djik did amazing long passes from the back. But Real Madrid midfield was too good. Modric was dancing around, Casemiro with great tackles and Kroos was just the perfect midfielder. Robertson tried to keep Valverde out of the game but Valverde slips past him in some occasions, and it lead to the goal. But the goal, Trent was caught ball watching and was marking Benzema while Konate was already doing it, leaving space for Vini to run into and score. Real Madrid defence was absolutely bonkers. Both teams defence were excellent but Liverpool had some defensive cracks, Carvajal was world class, his anticipation and strength, absolutely disgusting. Kept Luis Diaz out of the game. Mendy was good but had the occasional mispositioning which left Salah to do his thing but Courtois was THE BEAST.

massive respect to madrid. unfortunately they made themselves very likeable to me this season (see flair). insane mentality. i love that they didnt give a fuck about what anyone said. were underestimated four times straight. people wrote them off. people said chelsea would win. people said city would EASILY win this time. people said liverpool is a sure loss for them. i love their ""anti-hero"" arch. in the end they come out on top with a mic drop. stepped out there, followed their game plan, scored with the few chances they had (IMO Benzema's goal should've counted too as the ""pass"" wasn't intended) and defended extremely well against a tough opponent. Deserved win.

"There’s so much to say man.

Courtois easily motm, that was the best goalkeeping performance I’ve ever watched he should be top 5 at least for balon dor.

Although Liverpool had a lot of shots only a few of them were actually good chances like that mane one in the first half and the salah one in the 2nd. We once again showed how clinical we are tonight, literally first shot on target and it’s a goal lol. Valverde did brilliantly the whole match and leading up to that goal; Vini wasn’t at his best but it doesn’t matter he scored the winner what a season he’s had!! 

Carvajal was absolutely incredible single-handedly pocketed Diaz, what a return of form he had this season. Our whole defence especially in the second half was brilliant blocked sooo many shots and won so many headers, our low block compact defensive shape is so underrated 

Casemiro showed once again why he’s the best cdm in the world his defensive contributions for us is second to none, the amount of times he stole the ball of a Liverpool player or intercepted a pass or blocked a shot man he was phenomenal

For all the shit KCM got this season they dominated the midfield especially in the second half, the way kroos and modric would dance around Liverpool players or ping a 40 yard pass to get out of a press was beautiful. Kroos had such a great game too I can’t remember a single time he lost the ball under pressure from Liverpool’s suffocating press, best passer itw

While benzema didn’t score (should’ve with that offside one tho) he was still great, coming back to pick up the ball, helping relieve pressure etc. 

Vini was being defended brilliantly by konate but he still dribbled past him a few times and scored the winner lmao this kid improved so much this season it’s astounding. Trent completely lost him for that goal too lollll

A wonderful, dramatic and above all ass clencher of a season has come to a beautiful ending, commiserations to Liverpool they had a good season too

"Couple questions, especially for those that can be unbiased - first though, I am a Liverpool fan but I’m also pretty skeptical of my teams in any sport - but for all the talk about this team being one of the best ever, is that statement true? 3 finals, no goals, drew against City, Tottenham and Chelsea this year. Sure, they beat up lesser opponents but it seems that in big games, they don’t come through. Is it a factor if they aren’t as good as the “experts” say or is it that they run in to teams as talented as they are? 

Also, as much as TAA is a playmaker, his defensive lapses seem to come at the wrong time and/or are big lapses. Also helps that our two CBs provide him a ton of cover. So, is he as good as the experts say? 

And finally, a bit more of a statement but would welcome thoughts, can we just get a midfielder that can break down the low block? Someone with some creativity? I know Thiago has some of that passing creativity but something is lacking in the final third. Does Liverpool need a true striker? 

I know this might be better suited for the Liverpool board but I want some other opinions, like I said I can be critical of my team so would like other fans’ opinions.",1653777978.0,15,:r_soccer_user:,Soccer,3,N

"*Some thoughts on the game...*

* Very strange game that feels like it was played at about 75% intensity for the first half. Not sure if it was because of the delayed kick off or both sides being knackered but it definitely didn't feel like either side were at their best.

* Salah and Vinicius both struggled for much of the game but Trent and Mendy defended excellently too. In fact both sets of fullbacks were very good all game. Well almost...Trent had a very good game defensively but got caught out once and you're going to get punished at this level.

* Standouts were Courtois (what a save that was from the Mane shot) and Konate for me. The former's positioning was spot on all game and he did well to play it out of danger when pressed. Konate on the other hand was imperious- great on and off the ball.

* Our delivery all game was terrible. From corners, free kicks, and crosses. It was the best place to hurt Real Madrid and we butchered it horribly. 

* When you're up a goal there are very few players better than Modric and Benzema are relieving pressure. Anything at their feet was immediately brought under control and a pass was found. 

* In the end, there was no Real Madrid 'juju', they defended well and took their chance when they had it and desrevedly got the win. 

* As for Liverpool, I think we made enough chances to win it but ulimately took the wrong option too often and came across a keeper in incredible form.

* Courtois clear man of the match.",1653773690.0,3,:c_Liverpool:,Soccer,3,2F

"Courtois absolutely brilliant today, even if maybe Salah should have finished better. Still, can only save what they throw at you and he did so.

Think Klopp kinda bottled the subs a bit. Jota on for Diaz doesn't work when you're chasing a game, imo, as he's a better counter player and Liverpool needed someone who could trap the ball in the final third like Firmino. Salah was quite poor today, I thought, but I understand that it's hard to sub off a player that can create chances from almost nothing.

Some poor decision-making from Liverpool players as well when they got into actual good positions, while Real were mostly clinical (though they could have made it 2 and 3 but fucked it with the final decisions).

Real just had that CL voodoo and as soon as they scored first, you could just feel 1-0 at full time coming. Congrats to them.",1653774176.0,4,:pride::Arsenal:,Soccer,3,N

Playoff series show who is the best team. Bo1s show who is the best team on the night.

Fair play to Real, they were always in the game and although Liverpool were fucking brilliant for the first 40 minutes, however once the Benzema strike that was chalked off for offside it was Madrid's game. They took their only other chance of genuine quality and from there Liverpool couldn't match them unfortunately. It was a great game absorbing to fuck and both sides deserve massive credit. I do feel though that with the delay, I think Liverpool were ready to really go at the time the game should have kicked off and the delay unfortunately killed it for us.

And I think Liverpool do need something extra in midfield, but to be honest I'm not even sure what type of profile fits what they need, because on paper Thiago should solve the low-block. Keita simply hasn't been good enough (he does have flashes of brilliance), it could just be another player who can unlock a defence, but sometimes I think it's the way our front 3 plays that makes it easier to defend against in a low block

They are not overrated, they contesting first place in probably the strongest league, got to final of CL, won both in recent years, meaninf players are good. Arnold had an okay game, he made 1 mistake which shouldn’t have been decision making if Liverpool capitalized on so many great chances. 

>Jurgen

Has taken 2 teams that were not the best and made them either the best or contesting the beat in League and being a candidate for CL title, he is a great coach, and tries to say things as he sees them. I’d say based on his accomplishments his words have merrit.

>VAR

So what? I thought VAR is in most cases pretty much right. Yesterday we had clear enforcment of know rules and people ranted it wasn’t an offside even tho by rules it classifies as such.

But yeah yeah, Real is always the team playing the worse football but somehow beat PSG, Chelsea, City and Liverpool. Must be a coincidence or something.

- won UCL 5 of the last 9 years.
- won their 14th UCL. the next closest team is AC Milan with 7.
- won 14 of their 17 visits to the final ever.
- have not lost in a final for over 40 years.
- have Casemiro, Kroos and Modric for a decade, follow that up with Valverde, Camavinga, Tchouameni in midfield.
