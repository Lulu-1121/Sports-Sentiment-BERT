De Bruyne going off is a problem because as good as Foden is, he doesn't have that same ability that de Bruyne has to drop out of the midfield to find a bit of space.

Inter have kept their shape excellently, every defender when they can leaving 5 yards clear in front of themselves to give time and space to watch what City players are doing. Their forwards know what their role is, even dropping back when City's possession lasts longer than a few passes.

This causes City problems because it highlights their lack of pace on the wings. Front and back. Inter's WB's push up because they know Grealish/Bernardo ain't tracking back nor pulling away with speed on a counter.

Haaland is isolated then because he is the only pace City have in the team, and Inter's midfield are shutting that shit down. Can't remember the last time I've seen Gundogan sit so deep.

"Great UCL final for us neutrals (more so hate/frustration for 90% of the PL fans here but good football regardless lol) 

I won't lie I only tried to pay attention to the positions/space of the players for around 60'ish minutes before praying for the Lakaka memes to come true. However... 

I thought Inter did fantastic and were one of the few teams this season to give City a real fight.(especially defensively) City interestingly this time went for a back 3 with ONE PIVOT in Rodri. Stones/Gundogan occupied the  LCM/RCM with De Bruyne occupying the CAM position. They probably went with this shape because man to man Inter defended with 2 up top / 3 in the midfield outnumbering the usual double pivot formation City have had this season. 

City defended with 4 uptop and constantly pressured the 3 Inter defenders. However Onana was fantastic and was amazing at his feet. Constantly finding long balls to distribute away from that press/find the Wingbacks. Lukaku especially was amazing at receiving long balls to cushion for his teammates, creating chance after chance. (Don't ever let anybody say Lukaku played bad this game, he was phenomenal and created chaos in the City back line) Just unlucky in the end. 

MVP should go to Ederson just for keeping City alive in the end lol. City were a fun team to watch this season, and looking at it from a pure footballing perspective deserved this UCL. Pep finally found the solutions to his problems, constantly tinkering and experimenting. Whether its anything in life that type of forward thinking will yield you something new. New tactics for attacking/ defending.... exploiting specific areas of the field... finding overloads, etc. It's why he is one of the greatest managers in football.",1686460552.0,3,,Soccer,3,N

Our last hope is the rules violations in England, but if we're truly being honest with ourselves the FA and other governing bodies simply do not have the resources to take on an entire nation state. It's a shame because 15 years ago everyone was condemning Chelsea for the financially juiced club they were, yet City took that model into the stratosphere. And here we are. I won't be surprised if in 10 years only City, Newcastle, RM and PSG are the only clubs capable of winning a European Cup. And I won't be surprised when, outside of the oil clubs, youth engagement with football falls off a cliff and the game moves from community staple to the franchise, only wealthy allowed model we have in the US.

> City's goal came from the one moment in the game where there was no Inter player to immediately close down the City player.

That's just what you can do when you have some of the very best midfielders in the sport.

Even Stones is starting to take those shots - not well yet, but who knows. And then these guys rotate positions with the likes of Foden, Grealish, and Mahrez - keeping all of them starved of space is a very hard job.

I think Old Pep has started to embrace the idea that not everything can be set up as a tactic, not every game is won on the whiteboard - you need a solid plan and a good idea of how players should link up, but there is something that you cannot predict, something for which you just need great players. 10 years ago he wouldn't have bought a Haaland, maybe not even 5 years ago...
