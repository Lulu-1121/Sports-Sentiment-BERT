Wouldn't be surprised to see Sterling tanked at HT or shortly into the second for Aguero and City getting more direct, and I would bet Pulisic comes in around 55-60 to start running at people and be available for the counters that are sure to come.

Pep going with Gundogan as a defensive midfielder has been a massive issue. They haven’t been able to retrieve the ball early and as a result Chelsea have been able to counter attack, which resulted in the goal.


In addition, Chelsea’s attack has been making very good decisions. Either a good pass forward, or try to keep possession and build slowly if they can’t find a pass. So far the decision making has been tactically spot on.

I think Pep will have to introduce Fernandinho and Jesus. Gundogan or Silva will be off and I think Mahrez or Foden. These decisions will be interesting to keep an eye on.",1622317979.0,14,,Soccer,1,N

There was a little bit of luck involved in Chelsea's goal, but it was possible for that chance to be created because of the mess in midfield that Guardiola's line up exposed.

I kept hearing people compare this to 2012 when that’s not the case. In every single tie Chelsea was the better team easily… that wasn’t the case in 2012. Part of it is PSG being massively over rated and city beating them comfortably. 

I think Pep tinkering may not have helped the team… but he actually appreciated that even had city went in with their normal XI it may not have been enough. People keep saying if Fernandinho played or Rodri played or Aguero played. If the first two played they would have been over ran in the midfield and if aguero played he wouldn’t have done much against Chelsea’s cbs who cleaned everything up.

"The culture they've established at Chelsea since Abramovich took over is ruthless but they've stuck to it and haven't half arsed it when convenient.

Their recruitment is excellent and consistent, and they don't get sentimental about it. If a player wants to move, then they get a fee for him and move on. They don't get hung up on favouring homegrown players, even though they stockpile a boatload of them, when they aren't good enough. They don't worry about things like having one-club men and move players on when the path forward isn't mutually beneficial. 

As for coaches, everyone knows what they're signing up for now. You're backed with good players and transfer budget. You can't get the players winning then see you later, they'll find someone who can. None of this ""give him time and we'll re-evaluate in 3 seasons"". Expectations are clearly stated at front.


Players that sign for them know what they're signing up for. Managers the same. Whoever is running the football side of things are like complete cold blooded sharks and they're successful.

Im sure Chelsea have more trophies now than United since Abramovich took over. Sir Alex had 49 trophies - I don't know how many Chelsea have under Abramovich but I feel like they will definitely get there, albeit with 30 managers or whatever...",1622363720.0,1,:Manchester_United:,Soccer,3,N

the best way to counter a counter-attacking side is to break the momentum of their counters and reverse the play quickly while they're still caught in their breaking momentum,    without a DM you're handicapping yourself in regards to stealing that possession, and with the Attacking CMs on the flanks constantly dropping deep to retrieve, you have no options to reverse the play.

Rüdiger and Azpi also step up when the team has the ball to assist the attacking build up. 

Even attacking coaches like Bielsa have a rule of deploying a spare defender against the number of opposing forwards.

Kante is a great player no doubt, but he's more of an athlete than a gifted technical player. There's a clear cap to how good he is. He won't ever be the greatest midfielder ever, he's not even in the top 50 best midfielders ever and likely won't ever crack that list.
