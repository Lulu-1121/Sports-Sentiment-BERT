Man i'm so over Toni Kroos standing like a statue when he doesn't have the ball.

"Liverpool started the half terrifically, their press really unsettled Madrid. The front three all did their jobs well but the battle at that point was really won in midfield. The three Liverpool midfielders worked so hard to cut off the passing lanes and that meant Real just couldn't play out through their 4 central midfielders, having to resort to long balls or trying to move up the pitch through the wings. The injury was not only costly because they lost Salah but it also disrupted the press. It only takes 1 or 2 players to be slightly out of position for it to start to fall apart and that's what's started to happen, Kroos, Modric and Isco have been able to get on the ball in central areas far more, if that continues in the 2nd half Liverpool will be in big trouble imo.",1527363969.0,8,:England:,Soccer,1,N
"From Liverpool side, TAA has been amazing. Firmino was pretty dangerous early on too. Too bad he didn't get many chances near the end of this half.

RM has been depending mostly on their defenders to clear and then Kroos passes to Modric who then plays amazingly to pass the balll to Nacho and then the effort is defended well by LP.

Enjoying this game, but I wish Mo and Carvahal wouldn't have been injured.",1527363990.0,8,,Soccer,1,N

"Really was a bad set up from Klopp tonight. Keita coming in is a massive gamble from the off. I thought the aim would have been to try press them higher up, but we were constantly pinned in. 

Trent didn’t have a great game with our without the ball, but I think it was especially suicidal for our right side to be made of Philips, Trent and Keita. When Trent normally goes to press higher or move higher we have the midfielder tucking in to protect that area from being constantly exposed. I don’t think he was anywhere close to offering enough support. It is harsh as the rest of the midfield and front 3 didn’t do enough to press the likes of Kroos, but that was the area you could make a quick change and a statement. 

They were class all around, as much as they exposed us down our right. When defending they properly covered the runs from the fullbacks all game. Gave no space for the overlap",1617742377.0,191,:c_Liverpool:,Soccer,3,3U

But fuck me, the amount of times I heard how ""Liverpool should've overrun"", ""intimated"", ""pressured"" and ""ran circles around"" Modric-Kroos-Casemiro was absolutely baffling.

Those 3 have been the best midfield trio in the game for a long while. They're one of - if not the best - in football history.

They hit a rough patch after the WC when Modric and Kroos were noticably spent (especially Modric), but somehow the break last season made it all go away - they've been back to their best since the restart.

But all these pundits can see is that Modric is 35 and they think people should run him over.

Rio, Carra, Owen, those fools from ESPN... ""Overrun Kroos and Modric"".

I'm like, my man.... These two fuckers are possibly the most press-resistant duo ever (only Xavi/Iniesta in the same tier IMO). 
Real Madrid never got into issues following winning 4 CLs in 5 years due to their midfield, it was the one piece still ticking.
Ronaldo left, wingers are non-efficient, fullbacks are either injured or past it (Carvajal and Marcelo), but Modric-Kroos-Casemiro is still the fucking endboss of midfields.

""Overrun"" Modric.

Motherfuckers from ESPN - even at 35, I'd pick Luka Modric to build my midfield around in a CL final (and the ONLY competition would be KDB - and only because Modric is not in his prime).

I was surprised to see so many of the analysts pick Liverpool 

That defense is still just so awful

TAA has been terrible all year. I remember him getting subbed out of one match after going like 0-30 on crosses which is impossible 

Thiago has been terrible and a bad signing which many worried about 

The lack of pressing and urgency was just pathetic (no one near Kroos on first goal assist)

I don’t know how much of it was a game plan or just works out, but letting Liverpool press high despite a shit defense and then just letting vini out run people was almost too easy 


I know defense makes offense better but it’s also embarrassing how poor Liverpool offense was given no Ramos or varane, where are your expensive playmakers?? 

Salah got the goal but oof what a sad performance as a team

I don’t even know what adjustments Klopp would make. He can’t press or be more offensive when his defense is essentially non-existent with CBS just getting destroyed by Vini 

If I’m Zidane, I might not even start Benzema in leg 2, just throw your speed guys out there, sit back on defense to absorb pressure again and counter attack since it’s so easy with Kroos and Modric in midfield to launch the attack

"We all now KCM had a great game and Vinicius was finally what he should always be, but let's appreciate Nacho and Lucas Vazquez a bit more.

**NACHO** has always been a sub for Real Madrid, last season he barely played an as he was already on his 30's lot of people was already including him on the players the club should sell as he was no longer good enough even as a sub (I was one of them). Due to injuries from many of our players he had to play a lot this season and he proved again that whether you play him as RB, CB or LB he can play as good and sometimes even better that our starters in those positions. I'm really impressed to see that at the age of 31 he is even more reliable and physically as good as on his 20's.

**LUCAS VAZQUEZ a.k.a The Lord.** He has been memed multiple times. We all hated when Zidane decides to pick him to play on the right wing instead of playmakers as Bale, Isco, Asensio, Rodrygo, Vinicius and Isco. We all thought he was good to be an bench player but not good enough to get those players benched so regularly.... Then when Zidane give an opportunity to those more skillfull players we like, they struggled to prove they could be more reliable than him.  
The guy is 29 and like Nacho he was also one of the guys most of us thought should be sold, like Nacho due to injuries on or right wing he had a lot opportunities this year not only as a right winger but also as a right back! He has been proving all season why you can rely on him even more than many of those playmakers that we love to watch but struggle to put good performances on regular basis

I don't think we will win any title this season, but if we do it won't be just thanks to Karim, KCM, Vinicius, Varano or Ramos.

1. Real Madrid played with pace and precision.  Not every team can do that.  Really that's what separates elite players from good players.  I also think Liverpool allowed them to play at pace.  The midfield and central defense seemed terrified of the Madrid players.

2. Liverpool have forgotten how to press.  They put no effort forth on pressing.  They'll contest the ball, but gone are the days when the players hunted in packs and forced errors.

3. Sadio Mane seems over it.  Not sure what ""it"" is, but he seems over it.

4. Alisson is not an elite GK.

5. Alisson ruined Bobby by Baptizing him and converting him to being an Evangelical.  Bobby is no longer a mad man.  He is a mild mannered player that is basically a passenger.",1617745810.0,5,:Liverpool:,Soccer,3,3U

"Klopp getting outclassed by Zizu, again. Last time we didn't have the tools to beat Madrid's press or press them. Even before Salah went off, we were struggling to control the game. This time Klopp has fucking Thiago to pair with Fabinho& he chooses Gini, who has the tendency to display his invisible cloak technology from time to time. Look Gini is a great player, but he needs someone mopping up for him and shouting in his ear, usually hendo has done it brilliantly, but he clearly isn't good enough to control the midfield against fucking RM. 

Thiago, Fab & Keita are the perfect players to counter probably the greatest midfield trio in the competition. I am not upset by the scoreline or the performance, but because of the personals & tactics employed by Klopp. The game was lost before the kick-off itself. At times Klopp leaves so much to be desired when it comes to being tactically flexible & smart.  He even got the subs wrong. Gini & Mane should have come off for Ox/Jones & Firmino. I guess Jota was taken off from game management pov which is acceptable. 

Hate going to bed this late/ear;y in the morning so pissed about a football team & can't even go on run after a while because I'm tired of my multiple quick pre-game rituals.

We came out stronger in the second half, but by then the damage was done. Subs really didn't do anything for us at all, and I don't get why Kabak was brought off to put Fabinho out of position. Trent can consider himself a lucky boy for not getting two yellows, he lost his head a bit.

Instead we used Aubameyang and Pepe as an extra set of fullbacks and kept Ødegaard as our highest player instead of Lacazette. Basically just let Liverpool dominate the ball and left us with no outlets. Like obviously Real have much better players at a lot of positions but the strategy didn't do us any favors.

"First of all I'm not saying Modric does anything wrong, Modric is a fucking beast and one of the best players ever on and **off** the pitch.

I think good usage of the right PEDs is helping to lengthen careers left and right. PED's aren't just for creating muscle mass, strengh and and such. They can be used just in order to help with recovery and injuries more than anything, and they are amazing for that.

Football is full of PED's, like any other sport is. Even sports with really good anti doping programs are full of PED usages (football anti doping is a joke anyways). PED's for recovery are totally fine to me. If I had to guess I would guess EPO is a big thing in elite level football for example since it's really difficult to catch even with good anti doping programs and EPO is stupid good as a PED. If you follow any sport where PED are persecuted you know that shit's everywhere and catching it is a lot harder than using it haha.

We see players sleeping in hypoxia chambers (being Raúl a notable example) and that's the same principle as EPO for example. If sleeping in a champer enhances your performance and shortens the injuries... man, sleep in a chamber, I want to see you play as long as you can, specially if you are marvelous like Modric.

Yeah the first half lack of press *and* the high back line is on Klopp. Meme as much as you want on Trent or whoever, but honestly Klopp has to take the criticism here. The highline directly led to the first two goals, and we also gained no counterplay from the highline because of the bizarre lack of intensity in the press from the front. Absolutely bizarre.

"Couple notes I want to make note of.


1.) For the narrative of a high scoring final, with weak defenses, the back four for both teams were fantastic. Whether it be the RM being able to break down anything coming into their box or Liverpool with some amazing last ditch takes, it was a great sight to watch.


2.) Zidane did a great job setting up his team. Looked like he wanted to soak up pressure at first, knowing how Liverpool tend to tire later in matches. Yet when Salah went down they started pressing high knowing four men ready in defense would be stop most attacks. Wonder how things would've changed if Salah didn't leave, would've attempting to soak that pressure work? Then again bringing on a player like Bale can help any deficient that might've been.

3.) Liverpool really need more depth in attack over a new GK to me. Yes an improvement over Karius is important in the long run, but those mistakes were so odd I think a repeat of it is small. I do know Karius is prone to some errors, but before today he looked to be improving overall. Back to my original point, it's not about Salah, leaving but any of the front three. RM were able to double team Mane and Lallana didn't look fit, meaning Firmino and the midfield had little to do. Gini was the second best attacking player which says a lot. Being able to bring in a new winger or a creative midfielder might have seen Liverpool look largely unchanged after Salah left. Depth could've won this final imo.

With better midfielders and a better goalkeeper they'll be a very fun and scary team next year, specially in the Champions League.

From Madrid's pov, I loved Benzema. Like Mane, I think he was the one who better understood the match. Modric gave a master class too, he probably intercepted more balls than Casemiro and Kroos together.",1527464495.0,94,:Real_Madrid:,Soccer,3,3F

We took our time to settle down and Mo Salah's injury really took the gas out of them. We were really comfortable after that. Karius howler in the first goal is a goal that you never expect to see in a Champions League final. Liverpool did come back with Mane goal and were looking quite charged up at that point but Bale scored arguably the greatest goal in a Champions League final. What an impact did he have. He was just too good. Even at 2-1 Liverpool did have a chance but the third goal again. I feel for him as a person but having howlers in a game of this magnitude is inexcusable and that too twice.

"I see almost everyone commenting on how Liverpool pressed in the first 30 minutes. But to me, that was them at a low to average intensity. It looked like they were actually trying to conserve their energy a bit and only picking key moments to counterpress. 
 
They would have been well aware that Madrid would try to slow the game down and soak up the pressure of what is usually a fast start for Liverpool. I really think that wasn't a fast start at all - and the 'running out of energy' argument has been used on here a lot since the game, and I completely disagree. 

They did look shaken after Salah went off, but that's because their entire gameplan had to change, and when the press of the group is so important, it was natural to bring Lallana on (who I thought really started to initiate some nice pressing moves early in the second half before Bale's wonder goal).

tl;dr - 
- wasn't a fast start by LFC standards, i.e. not a tactical naivety from Klopp that some people claim
- Lallana was the only choice to bring on, so yes, depth is an obvious problem",1527469621.0,30,:Australia:,Soccer,3,N

With can leaving I’d like us to get a solid quality 6. 

Other than that well done Madrid. You won. We had you on the ropes until the salah injury but that’s no excuse. Two costly mistake cost us the game. 

Edit. I’m not bashing karius but I think he needs a higher quality keeper to compete with. He has had a fantastic season and I’d like Klopp to persist and allow karius to learn from this. He’d still get plenty of game time as back up keeper. ",1527464734.0,29,,Soccer,3,N
"Salah injury was huge, now how we normally set up is with Firmino dropping deeper to press, Mane to the left of him being allowed to drop a bit, whilst Salah stands on the line ready to break. We just lost the balance of the side when Salah went off forcing the shape just that much deeper. I don't think it was Firmino's game once Salah goes off. Marcelo is just given so much more room to roam given he doesn't have to worry about Salah behind him. Mane did well carrying the ball from deep repeated, brilliant performance from him. 

Impressive control in the midfield from Madrid once Salah went off, tired us out on the ball and we had to play on emotion second half with the few chances we got. 

I do think they possibly missed a trick going for the two men upfront, Van Dijk and Lovren seemed fine forcing Ronaldo and Benzema wide when they had to. ",1527463836.0,31,:c_Liverpool:,Soccer,3,3U
"Match really took a turn with the Salah injury. Real looked terrified to move in too deep. After he was taken off, the entire pace of the game changed.

Score is a shame too because Liverpool actually did very well defensively",1527463580.0,77,,Soccer,3,N
"I think this was a game of a high strategic and tactical level where individual events ended up deciding the difference far more than any huge gap in quality or tactical/managerial decision or blunder did. Real ended up proving their superiority, but only because probability/luck went against Liverpool to a great degree, as opposed to them actually being outplayed or exposed. 

I'd say that in the first half hour, a Salah-led Liverpool actually outplayed Real, or were at least showing stronger signs of momentum, with their game plan and high press working really well against a midfield-heavy Madrid. Zidane knew what he was doing holding Bale for an impact later in the game, but I also think he went for the same team as the last final because he believed that they could again win the midfield and dominate eventually as they did against Juventus last season. This, however, played into Liverpool's early setup and high press, much like City played into it with Guardiola trying to pack their midfield with Gundogan, it almost made it easier for the coordinated press to get the ball back and Salah to pull the creative strings, which he was clearly managing well until his injury. Therefore, I think eschewing a very in-form Bale for Isco ended up not really working as intended, at least for that first half hour, Isco just was not fed the ball enough and the press put Liverpool in the driving seat, and with some better finishing and faster execution they would have opened the scoring.

Which brought us to the first decisive event that played a huge role in changing the script of the game, Salah's injury. It's obvious how huge this development was, but beyond the loss of Salah's central dictation of the counterpress and creative abilities in utilizing the ball once it was won back in conjunction with Firmino, the other noteworthy shift was in the psychology of the team. Without Salah, you could feel some of the belief drain out of Liverpool. They eventually recovered well, led by Mane in particular (and a resolute defense), but it was a massive loss that put a Liverpool on the front foot on the defensive, and they never recovered momentum enough to be on the front foot again. The first half ended up being a story of sad injuries after this, as Carvajal also suffered his own upsetting injury which cost Real some fluidity on his side of the pitch, but it certainly didn't faze the hardened, experienced and more balanced Real players and team as Salah's loss did to Liverpool. So that was the first major shift, and Real began to control the tempo leading into the end of the first half.

The second major shift was, of course, the terrible first mistake of Karius, which I still have a hard time processing as having actually happened on this level of the sport, at the pinnacle of club football, a final of this magnitude. Credit to Real here, they came in very strong in the second half and looked like scoring, and 100% should have with Isco hitting the bar. It came from a Liverpool defensive lapse, and had Isco buried it as he should have, the blame would have been on the defense and midfield of Liverpool (shaken by Real's early attacking potency) more than anything. However, they survived, but then Karius did the unthinkable, so it all fell on him, simple as that. Liverpool were on the back foot, and may have conceded eventually anyway, but if they had survived for ten more minutes, going past the hour mark, things may have been very different. However, conceding that freak goal actually spurred them on to score their own, which also would likely not have occurred so soon had Real continued to exert their pressure. It's hard to say just how differently this would have developed without Karius's mind-boggling lapse in judgment, but it without a doubt shattered much of the tactical setup the game had settled into from the first half.

Then the third major event occurred, partially supported this time not by a freak error and insane probability, but by an amazing bench substitution and good timing by Zidane, who was wrong in not starting Bale but still very right in timing when his in-form player had to come in, showing that while his selection was a bit off in my opinion on a strategic level compared to Klopp, his ability to tactically read a game is still very much there (as he has proven again and again). The moment Bale came in I felt he'd make a difference, his last few games proved as much, but I had no idea he'd make a difference in the WAY he managed to, an absolutely beyond world-class goal which, as with Karius's freak mistake, could not have been accounted for. Mane had helped push Liverpool back into the game rapidly, but Bale came in and gave Real their momentum and fire back, and MORE with that ridiculous finish.

To round it off, a couple of other events that ended up settling the game were Mane's post (which was close but needed to be hit a bit better to really balance the game again) and then Bale's second goal, which again saw an already mentally damaged Karius drop the ball (literally) again, ending Liverpool's hopes despite their grit to fight on and amazing defensive struggle to stay in the game (Robertson's tackle on Ronaldo and Lovren's on Bale were majestic, as good as goals). Karius's second howler was a far more common one in general compared to the near-unique first error, but it was still a shot that should have been saved 95% of the time, regardless of the ball's movement. Karius initially went for a punch I believe, but changed his mind too late to go for what should have been a relatively easy catch, which led to the result we saw...

Mane, Liverpool's defense, and even Klopp's strategic setup and tactical shifts in tightening his team following the loss of their counterpressing instrumentality (Salah was needed for Firmino to really function, and vice versa, thus Firmino's disappearance from the game) were all exemplary, and I really don't think the manager or team were really at fault or outplayed in any significant way. The keeper cost them the game, though Madrid's amazing quality in midfield (the best in the world, to be frank) did eventually shine through as superior of course (Modric pulling the strings over Kroos this time around) while Bale was the catalyst offensively, on a night where you realized just how good Liverpool were defensively to keep someone of Ronaldo's unmatched positional prowess as quiet as they did. Ronaldo lacked the sharpness we've seen before in him, but this was clearly also a testament to Liverpool that he was put off enough not to join the scoring when he could have and should have. Va Dijk commanded the defense amazingly just as he has been doing ever since he joined the team.

All in all, congratulations to Madrid, they are worthy winners and have created a legacy as one of the best teams in the history of European football with this treble of CL wins (and 4 in 5, amazingly!), but unlike last season's final (which was their zenith as a team in this aforementioned historical period, I believe), they didn't completely outplay this Liverpool side, specific circumstances and events helped them a great deal in edging a Liverpool that, at their best, could have won this game with Salah leading their initial tactical gameplan under Klopp, and managed to still almost be on par with Madrid even afterwards, with their own keeper shooting them in the foot to seal the deal. Bale was deserved man of the match, but I feel for Liverpool because on any other night, with both teams starting the same way and Salah avoiding injury, I think they would have had this game or at least had the edge in winning it. Alas, we shall never know, but congratulations to both teams for a very high-level and intense final regardless, it has been an amazing Champions League season, and it will be very hard to top moving forward.

"There's something to be said about this match, and it's how reminiscent of how Klopp's last CL final went against Bayern Munich, in the points below:

* Klopp's side intense pressed for the better of the 1st 30 minutes, and while that resulted in chances, it didn't actually mean goals.
* Match at 0-0 at the half, with Klopp's side seeing fatigue.
* Klopp's opposing side, with more talent, started to impose their will.
* Blatant goalkeeper error.
* Right-winger terrorising Klopp's side, with the error that led to goal.

With all that said, it can't be understated with how different Salah's involvement meant for this Liverpool side. Their lack of means to do anything for the remaining 10 minutes of the half was a bit baffling, and they got out alive to regroup. They needed it, especially given how well they were winning the ball and catching, at many times, some sluggishness in defensive transitions Madrid were in, as we saw against both Bayern and Juventus.

Regardless, Madrid did about as much it could to when it was given opportunities to take advantage of. Benzema, like that other time against Ulreich, scored when he had to. Given all the memes about how he doesn't score, he did what he had to and did it well. Those waves of attacks I felt did somewhat unnerve Liverpool, even when they equalised, because the feel was that Madrid would eventually impose their will just because of their quality, and that's something we've seen in previous finals as well, most noted the 1st time again Atleti when Ramos got that late goal and the floodgates opened in AET.

"See a lot of people commenting that Madrid were totally dominated until Salahs injury. 

It's just that for the first 20-25 minutes, Liverpool ALWAYS look like the better team. It's their style of play. Intense attacking football for 20 minutes, but that style is just not sustainable for 90 min.
That's the reason why Liverpool concede so many late goals.

It's often said about Zidanes Madrid that they have no tactics or definite style. But if you look at all these big games, Madrid tends to ""sit back"" for the first 20 minutes to analyse and see what kind of game it'll be and adjust their gameplan accordingly.

Even without Salahs injury i think the game would have played out pretty much the same.

Have to praise both teams for their defensive displays. Pool looked very disciplined and  of Madrid's back line I have to single out Varane and Nacho as they had wonderful games. 

Modric absolutely dominated the midfield. Kroos had a bad first half IMO, and Milner had a bad game. 

Benzema showed once again what a brilliant player he is. Alongside Modric and Bale I think he was one of the best players. 

From Liverpools attackers, Mane was the only threat, but man was he brilliant. Really rose to the occasion after Salahs injury 

And I feel like I need to say that the referee had a good game. Can't recall a single huge error he did. 

A real shame that Salah and Dani got injured, really hope they will heal until the world cup. Especially Dani as he's missed the last two international tournaments due to injuries.

"Liverpool looked great with Salah, they were pressing high and creating chances, obviously as seen throughout the season, once Salah (or even Mane) go off, they lose their edge while the substitutes they have can't fulfil the role, which Is why they must address their lack of attacking depth in the summer.

Personally, I think bringing on Lallana was the worst choice considering his fitness and lack of effectiveness out wide, the change should've either of been brining Can on into the midfield and pushing Milner/Wijnaldum to the top 3 or brining on Solanke.

Liverpool should be proud of everything they've achieved in the CL this season, they have a extremely talented squad and with the right additions, might even do a Bayern and make the finals again next year, it's in their own hands.

But when they don’t get the early goal, those are the games they often lose because they don’t have the energy to keep that level of intensity up for the whole game and they struggle to score. 

Real, on the other hand, typically sit back and absorb pressure for the first 20 minutes and then slowly let their superior talent take over. Once they get their grip on a game, they are relentless.

I think Liverpool would have at least kept the intensity up until the half ended (and even had one more burst near the end of the half), and the decisive factor would have been whether Liverpool could have scored. We'll never know, obviously, but if they'd gone into the second half with a 1-0 lead and Salah on the pitch at his best (and he looked sharp before his injury), the counterattacking game 100% suited them in the second, they've been able to end games before in that way, as long as the defense was tight and solid (and against Real, the defense was immense much of the time).

It's all conjecture and speculation of course, but just as Real could have eventually overpowered Liverpool anyway, Liverpool could have just as easily had it go their way in the method I describe.

"Counter point - the actual timing to volley the ball in Zidane’s case is more difficult than Bale’s. Bale’s was a floated cross, the ball was arriving at Bale *much slower* than it arrived at Zidane, making Zidane’s margin for error on timing much smaller. Plus I’ve never seen a swivel volley quite the same as that from Zidane, whereas we do see bicycle kicks reasonably often.

Well yes. If you beat teams like Madrid you get a CL trophy. If you beat teams like palace you get a trophy none of the top teams cared enough to go for.,1527505183.0,0,,Soccer,3,N

"Yes. Too focused on winning bigger things. Also we dont get drawn against teams like Derby every year. We always draw other premier league sides.

"It is going pretty well, we were one game away from winning the biggest trophy in football and a freak injury derailed it.

Well unlike United we play our kids in the FA cup and league cup so yes it is trickier to beat other prem teams.

End of the day Liverpool fans are buzzing about our progress, United fans are going on fan TV saying they want to hang themselves and JOSE OUT.

I know which club is in the better place.

Keep changing ya tune mate. Last 5 exits from domestic cup competition:

Leicester City, Southampton, West Bromwich Albion, 	Wolverhampton Wanderers, West Ham United. Tough opposition.
