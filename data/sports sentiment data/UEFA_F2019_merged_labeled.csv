"Sometimes finals are cagey. Nerves and pressure play a big part. I think both teams know each other very well and both teams are dangerous. The early goal made things difficult for Liverpool as they wanted to protect the lead. Trent and Robertson played more like full backs than the attacking wingback they are. 

Spurs were really poor in the final third. Eriksen was anonymous and Dele wasteful. Kane needs service as he's a striker and these two didn't provide anything. Son worked hard but his technique let him down, which is unusual. Moura didn't add anything really and missed two good chances. 

Both defences played well though and I think this also had an impact on the lower tempo. It was a shame the game didn't flow, but it tends to be the case in finals with teams from the same Country.

I'm a Spurs fan, but Liverpool have been excellent this season and deserved a trophy. Im gutted it was at our expense. I'm interested to see what transfers we make this summer, but I'd like to see an alternative to Dele or a system without him.",1559424794.0,11,:r_soccer_user:,Soccer,1,N

Winks and Sissoko arent sufficient to pass through the Liverpool press.

Alli, Eriksen, Kane, and Son sitting so high up the pitch while the CBs, Winks, and Sissoko struggle almightily to get the ball out of their own half is completely pointless. Because of the shape of the team, its like Tottenham is playing 4 men down.

Kane is useless because Matip and VVD are double-teaming him, Winks and Sissoko have no hope of pass through this Liverpool midfield on their own when Alli and Eriksen are so far up the field. Their only outlets are long balls or broken plays.

Winks dropping between the two CBs so the CBs arent out-numbered by Liverpools front 3 when building up, and Eriksen dropping further back would help them build properly",1559417848.0,4,,Soccer,1,N

Unfortunately the early goal made Liverpool want to play much safer so they're not punishing as much as they could, playing a ton of long balls.

Lucas with a little luck could make an instant impact if they keep their strategy, Tottenham had some good moments with quick passing between Alli and Eriksen and they could use someone else to not depend on Son dribbling today.

Handling the ball involves a deliberate act of a player making contact with the ball with the hand or arm.

The following must be considered:
• the movement of the hand towards the ball (not the ball towards the hand) 
• the distance between the opponent and the ball (unexpected ball)
• the position of the hand does not necessarily mean that there is an offence

"Spurs fan checking in:

First up, congratulations to Liverpool. You scored the goals, you deserved it. I'm still not sure about the penalty, but I would have to have another look.

Apart from that, I'd say both teams looked kind of lackluster. Not sure why that was. I personally think starting Kane was a mistake.

I'm sad, sure, but not quite as upset as I thought I'd be. I guess because I feel the future is still bright, as long as things don't fall apart now.

End of the day, the season as a whole was quite poor yet we still finished in the top four and got to a European final. Given I know the team has a higher ceiling, that's progress. Now it's down to Levy to show Poch it's worth sticking with us by making some serious investment in the squad.

That's the end of football for me until August as I generally don't care about international football (apart from liking good matches). See you all then.

As an aside, I watched at the Spurs stadium screening. And it was a good experience. But not something I'd do again. I think I prefer how I usually watch televised games that I don't have a ticket to: at home, on my couch with my girlfriend and my cats",1559425002.0,5,:England:,Soccer,3,N

"Biggest takeaways on rewatching the highlights:

1. This was Madrid? It sounded like freaking Anfield and the Kop End.
2. The very moment the final whistle is blown, Migs sprinted across the field straight into Ali - imagine the class of that, since he was left out in last year's finals, and again this year.
3. Ali gets most of the kudos for the match, but look at Trent's tackles at Son and Ali when he was last man + how he avoided making rash challenges that would get him easily passed + the way he sprinted in celebration in the second goal was so Gerrard-esque!!!
4. If Son didn't have to worry about mandatory military enlistment (before the exemption), he would probably be in one of the big boys teams now - what a player, such silky runs, would have been a phenomenal Klopp player with his passion and workrate.
5. Everyone's comments on the boring match is a testament to our defence more than anything, in my opinion. Matip has been a solid rock even though the spotlight is (rightly) on Virg.

Walk on through the rain

Though your dreams be tossed and blown

With hope in your heart

"First off that was not a penalty. If they give that they'll have to be giving multiple pens every match. Simply awful reffing there. The rules need to change cuz right they're ridiculous, a nonsense and are actively ruining the spectacle. Certainly tonight that shit ref call changed the match and handed Liverpool the win essentially. It changed the match.

Secondly regarding Spurs: Kane was not in any way match fit. He should not of started. Poch made a mistake there. I mean playing a player whose been out for 2 months and his first game back is the Champions League final etc.. It was madness. Kane was never gone be on it 100%. Moura really shouldve started. Certainly he wouldve provided more of a threat with his pace, directness and runs in behind etc.. Alas Spurs had no cutting edge and were waay too slow. I also thought Eriksen was really bad tonight, totally anon, and dare i say it but imo Eriksen put in a very Ozil peformance, he was awful. Likewise Delo Ali was utter rubbish too(as he has been all season). I also think Poch waited too long to make subs.


Lastly i dont think Liverpool were very good either. All they did was long ball-counter attcking football, it was really not like Livdrpool. I still think Spurs couldve and shouldve won the game. I mean Spurs were totally bossing the 2nd half, they were all over Liverpool, but just couldnt make it happen. Liverpool were there for the taking. Bht it was so, so, sooooo boring & disappointing a final in all honestly though. The fact that it was decided by a shit and wrong ref call leaves a bad taste in the mouth though.

"Completely agree. When Spurs played Liverpool at Anfield Moura was so dangerous with his pace and was a real threat whenever he got on the ball. Kane is a brilliant striker no doubt about that, but he should've been subbed because the system wasn't working.

Firmino was one one of Liverpool's best players this season but he barely showed in the final and Klopp subbed him fairly early. As much as Kane deserves to be there, playing him was the wrong decision. Moura would've been a lot more of a problem for Liverpool's defence.

Maybe a bit of sentimentality from Pochettino that has backfired but hopefully he will learn from it and Spurs can go again next season. They've been great to watch this year and with a few signings in the summer they should be challenging much closer to Liverpool and City which is only good for the league.

"Absolutely. Whilst Kane and Winks were injured our team was forced to come together as a cohesive unit, and we achieved better results than with them.     
 
Moura is not a better player than Kane on paper. But as a component of this squad he gets a hat-trick vs Ajax and is instrumental to us getting to the final.

Can't really make a call on right or wrong tactics. When they get a penalty one minute in it changes the complexion of the game completely. From there Liverpool can focus on defending so of course Kane is going to find the game more difficult.,1559442286.0,5,:Tottenham_Hotspur:,Soccer,3,3U

Correct. We decided to pass the ball directly to their back 4 instead of going for goal. Unfortunately they were onto us and insisted on giving the ball back for 60 minutes.

They have one less goal conceded compared to City within the PL, so at least in the PL both players are clearly within the top three performers for their respective positions this season.

That doesn't make someone CLEARLY the best GK nor the best defender. You could argue that they were those within the PL and that VVD deservedly won best player. However, both Ederson and Laporte are in the PL team of the year for a reason. They also enter that discussion.

That's just the PL though. The moment you go abroad, there are even more players who enter that discussion. I think it's certainly fair to say that both VVD and Allison are contenders when it comes to best players in their respective positions **this season**.

Maybe you just dont like football? Has that thought crossed your mind? Football is the biggest sport in the world. Most fans. You saying all those go to matches to watch something boring?,1559424821.0,6,:England:,Soccer,3,N
"No, I initially said u have 0 PREMIER LEAGUE titles. To which u replied u have 18. U were wrong about that . Don't waste my fucking time

"Everyone knows Kronke is a bad owner, what do you want me to do? Defend him blindly? If anything, why’re you so obsessed with him. You’ve brung him up in everyone of your replies. 

And in response to being a rising club, are arsenal not also doing that? The difference is that arsenal have already achieved the highs of winning the league. Which is why we are an infinitely better club. Which was what my original point was about when I said you wouldn’t understand. I don’t know why you are obsessively trying to turn this into an argument about kronke",1559506948.0,1,:Arsenal:,Soccer,3,N
"Are you not listening on purpose? The Majority of football matches are boring. You could give me 10 highly entertaining, high scoring matches and I could give you 50 boring matches. 

I’m not saying football is boring, far from it, but with the way the game has developed and how teams have gotten so scared to concede, it’s become boring.",1559424903.0,-4,,Soccer,3,N

Actually you are wrong. There are more goals scored these days. The trend has gone towards more goals over the years. https://www.statista.com/statistics/269029/number-of-goals-scored-at-fifa-world-cups-since-1930/,1559425382.0,6,:England:,Soccer,3,N
"Hahahha you're a fucking idiot. Keep bringing up irrelevant points. We could go on all day

History is irrelevant . City have a better future and better present. Keep clinging on to titles u won a hundred years ago if it makes you feel better about being a mid table club for the past ten years",1559430415.0,-4,,Soccer,3,N
"1. That’s not good for your argument. There were 2 goals in today’s game, does that make it good?

2. This is the World Cup, a once every 4 years event. 

3. Goals scored doesn’t equal a better game, nor an entertaining game.",1559425577.0,-3,,Soccer,3,N

"You said that games were boring because teams are scared to concede, implying that teams dont concede as many goals. I then proved that you were factually wrong. It also applys to other tournaments then the WC btw so theres that. Goals scored doesnt necessarily equal a better game, I agree. However you brought that up as an argument? So what is your argument? Are you saying that football players are objectively worse at the game these days, which is wrong btw. I really dont see what you are trying to say. More goals scored in the modern game. Higher intensity, better technique and better players. 

I think you are just an American tbh.",1559426217.0,6,:England:,Soccer,3,N

"How many games were Man United (a team that consistently sold out their 75,000 ticket allocation every home game) genuinely exciting to watch this season? 

I’m not American. 

I’m talking more about the slow build more than anything, also the fact teams time waste with 20 minutes to go, and the fact whenever a lower positioned team plays a top side, they sit back for 90 minutes playing for the 0-0 (which is my main point for teams being scared to concede.)
